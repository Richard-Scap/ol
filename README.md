###Database Creation & Initialization *(note: we are using PostgreSQL)*

- Create development, test, and production databases

  `$ rails db:create:all`

- Migrate db

  `$ rails db:migrate`

- Seed db (this may take a few minutes)

  `$ rails db:seed`

###Running the API

- Serve API on localhost:3000

  `$ rails start`

- To get the index, go to <localhost:3000/api/businesses> in your browser

- To get a particular business, go to localhost:3000/api/businesses/:id and replace ':id' with the id of the business you are looking for.
